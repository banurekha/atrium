An explicitly declared subset of the total facets can be applied\r\nto these items. A collection description and or featured items form the\r\ncollection can be displayed at the top level collection page. Collections can be\r\nthemed independently of the base application and other collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Exhibits\r\n\r\nAn exhibit is a customizable view of a single topic (as defined by a facet),\r\nfurther scoped by an optional Solr query. An exhibit defines it's own\r\nhierarchical list of facets. An exhibit may also have a description and a list\r\nof featured items.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Showcases\r\n\r\nA showcase is a container for storing feature items and descriptions. A showcase\r\ncan be attached to a collection, exhibit, or to specific combinations of\r\nselected facets and facet values within an exhibit. There can be multiple\r\nshowcases in an exhibit.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThanks to [Hiten Parmar][2] for the gem name.
