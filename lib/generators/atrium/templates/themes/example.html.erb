  Theming atrium isn't very sophisticated.
  When a collection is given a theme it renders all the atrium views using a different layout file.
  A custom layout file can be as simple as this one which fills in the optional content blocks present in the default layout and little else.
  Alternatively you could copy the default layout from within the gem to the 'atrium_layouts' directory and make whatever changes you want to it.
  For more information about nesting layouts see: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-nested-layouts
