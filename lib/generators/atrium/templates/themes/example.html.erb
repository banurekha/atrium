  Theming in Atrium isn't very sophisticated.  When a collection is given a
  theme it renders all the atrium views using a different layout file.

  A custom layout file can be as simple as this one. It simply fills in the
  content blocks present in the default layout. For a greater degree of freedom
  you can copy the default layout from within the gem to the 'atrium_layouts'
  directory in this application and make whatever changes you want to it.

  For more information about nesting layouts see:
