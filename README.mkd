# Atrium

__Atrium is still a work in progress. Do not count on any of the present or
promised functionality to exist.__


## What it's for

Atrium is a tool for:

  - grouping items
  - adding context

to an index in a [Blacklight][1]-enabled application.

Atrium provides three mechanisms to achieve this end:

  - Collections
  - Exhibits
  - Showcases


### Collections

A collection contains a subset of the items in the complete index as defined by
a Solr query. An explicitly declared subset of the total facets can be applied
to these items. A collection description and or featured items form the
collection can be displayed at the top level collection page. Collections can be
themed independently of the base application and other collections.


### Exhibits

An exhibit is a customizable view of a single topic (as defined by a facet),
further scoped by an optional Solr query. An exhibit defines it's own
hierarchical list of facets. An exhibit may also have a description and a list
of featured items.


### Showcases

A showcase is a container for storing feature items and descriptions. A showcase
can be attached to a collection, exhibit, or to specific combinations of
selected facets and facet values within an exhibit. There can be multiple
showcases in an exhibit.
